                <h3>“When I entered the bathroom after him, it smelled as if Ghar trees grew inside”</h3>
                <p>
                    When I smell Ghar soap now,
                    its scent brings to mind moments from my childhood.
                    The sweet fragrance of the soap echos the joy and peace of that time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whenever my father used the bathroom, he would always take a whole bar of Ghar soap with him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ghar soap is almost twice as big as the average soap here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He would use a completely new bar of soap because he didn't like to use a used one.
                    He always wanted a new bar of soap for himself.
                    If there was soap for guests who used the bathroom, he would never use it.
                    He found it disgusting.
                    That's why he always used a new bar of soap.
                    Until now it remains a mystery for me how he could manage to use up the whole soap.
                    Anyone can have a wash ten times without using up the soap. Somehow, he managed.
                    When I entered the bathroom after him, it smelled as if Ghar trees grew inside
                    When someone uses the soap before you
                    you smell nature and Ghar vapour. 
                    The smell is wonderful to have in the bathroom.
                </p>
                <p>
                    
                    In Syria we put a lot of attention and care in our bathrooms.
                    Most people have dark blue porcelain tiles on the walls.
                    The lower part of the wall is blue, the middle has a line that's decorated with Arabic calligraphy
                    the upper part has lighter porcelain tiles.
                    When inside, it's wonderful to be able to enjoy the beauty of the design of a bathroom.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our bathroom was big and had a shower in the middle.
                    It was bigger than the one I have at the moment.
                    I always asked my mother how my father could use a whole bar of soap in one bathing session.
                    Even if he would be eating it, it couldn't be all be gone after just one bath!
                    When I grew up, thanks to capitalism, I thought Dove soap and other brands were better because of the advertisements on TV.
                    The soap looked rich, foamy and luxurious.
                    But when I became a bit older and wiser ...
                    ... I realised that Ghar soap was natural and better than the commercial brands.
                    And that it had just been the influence of capitalism on everyone.

                <h3>
                “I saw how the workers were stamping the soap, and wanted to try it myself.”</h3>
                <p>
                    Whenever I see the soap here it triggers wonderful memories from when I was a child
                    and my father would take me to our factory.
                    herinnering verleden tijd
                    Going with my father to the factory where the soap was made,
                    I saw how the workers were stamping the soap, and wanted to try it myself.
                    That was a memorable experience!
                    I used to invite my schoolmates to come to our factory to see how the soap was produced.
                    My schoolmates could see how workers would process it, cut it, and stamp it.
                    So they would see clearly how much effort it took to make the soap.</p>
                <p>
                    Ghar soap is not manufactured by using machines, but made manually.
                    To produce the soap you need a large vat.
                    The workers begin by adding natural olive oil.
                    As soon as the oil starts boiling, natural materials are added to make it more solid.
                    Once the soap has boiled, they pour it out and spread it over the floor of the factory.
                    It needs to cool down and stay in place until it becomes completely solid.
                    Using long knives, they cut the soap into bars that are left to dry.
                    Afterwards the workers collect the bars and pile them up like small houses.
                    The last step used to be to wrap them for export to the places where the soap was to be sold.</p>
                <p>
                    I’m proud of this Syrian Aleppo product.
                    And how my homeland is a pioneer in its production.
                    The unique fragrance reminds me of my father.
                    (God bless him and our factory).</p>
                <p>
                    Kadah factory was a very well-known producer of Ghar soap.
                    It covered 2000 square meters and consisted of four storeys.
                    Up to 2500 tons of Ghar soap was produced each year.
                    We had 70 employees.
                    My father used to export to the United States, France, Canada, Japan and China.
                    Soon after our brand became popular and many people had become aware of it,
                    the war broke out and our factory stopped producing soap.</p>
                <p>
                    We pray that war will come to an end.
                    Then we can rebuild the factory and produce our soap again.</p>

                <p>
                    Ghar soap is my friend for life.
                    Whenever I smell Ghar soap it brings back memories of my wedding day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My friends teased me.
                    As I went to bathe in the hammam, they melted Ghar soap in some water.
                    When I asked the hammam staff to hand me my towel, my friends threw the melted soap at me.
                    Once I had finished bathing, we went outside.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our tradition is that the family of the groom
                    orders food and we eat together after the groom has bathed.
                    Once we finish eating and drinking our tea
                    we smoke the water pipe.
                    This all takes place in the outdoor area of the hammam.
                    Inside is for bathing while its outdoor area is for drinking tea, eating, singing and having a feast.
                    Sometimes people will invite a singer
                    with a lovely voice, to perform for the groom.
                    These songs are a farewell to being an unmarried man.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Later on we left the hammam and held a small party at our home...
